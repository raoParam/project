  {
    question: "What are ARGO floats?",
    answer: "ARGO floats are autonomous robotic instruments that drift with ocean currents and move up and down between the surface and a depth of 2000 meters, measuring temperature, salinity, and other ocean properties. There are nearly 4,000 active floats in the global ARGO array."
  },
  {
    question: "How do ARGO floats work?",
    answer: "ARGO floats use a hydraulic system to change their buoyancy. To descend, they pump oil into an external bladder, increasing density. To ascend, they retract the oil, decreasing density. They typically complete a cycle every 10 days: 9 days drifting at depth (usually 1000m), then descending to 2000m before ascending to the surface while collecting data."

  {
    question: "What measurements do ARGO floats collect?",
    answer: "Core ARGO floats measure temperature and salinity throughout the water column. Many newer floats also measure dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll fluorescence, nitrate concentrations, pH, and other biogeochemical parameters. Some specialized deep floats can measure down to 6000 meters."

  {
    question: "How long do ARGO floats last?",
    answer: "ARGO floats typically have a lifespan of 4-5 years, during which they can complete about 150-200 cycles. Their operation is limited by battery life and the number of times they can cycle between depths."

  {
    question: "How is ARGO data used?",
    answer: "ARGO data is used for climate monitoring, ocean forecasting, research on ocean heat content, sea level rise studies, understanding ocean circulation, and validating satellite measurements. The data helps scientists track changes in the ocean's role in Earth's climate system."
